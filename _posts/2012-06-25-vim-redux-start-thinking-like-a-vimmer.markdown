I got introduced to VIM when I started my graduate school. My first job had me
use Linux as our primary machine and I continued to use VIM for Python
development.

Once I moved to my new (current) job, we all use Mac as our main system and I
decided to try out some of the popular GUI editors specifically TextMate and
Sublime Text 2.

After investing considerable amount of time between the two to learn, understand
use it the way they visioned - I found something was missing. Not sure which
part I didn't like about the "GUI" editors but even with features like project
management, grepping within multiple files etc. working out of box, editing was
not as fun.

So I looked around to found inspiration to use VIM again. Luckily, as with
everything else Google never fails and here are series of articles that you
should really read upon whether you are beginner or an experienced VIM user. I
believe they are able to give a very new understanding to the problem of editing
with VIM.

* [Your problem with VIM is that you don't grok vi](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118)
* [Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html)
* [The Vi/Ex Editor](http://www.networkcomputing.com/unixworld/tutorial/009/009.html)

I hope these links inspire you to look into VIM again or just improve your
knowledge.
