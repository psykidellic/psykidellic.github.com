bq. Apple appeared confident in its position of strength in the tablet market continuing. We believe that Apple is not too concerned about the low-priced entrants

iPad tablet sales aren't being effected and growth and sales projections continue.  It is business as usual for Apple.

bq. Amazon's success may just vaporize other "for profit" Android tablet OEM roadmaps

The biggest competitor to Android tablets is Android itself through Amazon's Kindle Fire.  As I mentioned the other day "the Kindle Fire defines the bottom end in tablet pricing":/2011/12/02/Commentary.html#kindle_fire.

The base price is so low that others such as Dell which "recently discontinued the Dell Streak 7":http://www.streaksmart.com/2011/12/dell-streak-7-no-longer-being-sold-from-dells-website.html can't compete as they rely on profits through hardware sales.
