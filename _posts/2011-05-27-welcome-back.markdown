Hello, after a long hiatus and multiple attempts to get back to
blogging, I think the time ripe is to take another attempt. Recently, I
read [a great article][] by zzzeek which made a lot of sense. It seems
that blogging would me much fun using the said workflow. Another [blog
post][] pointed out similar issues that I was having with my old
Wordpress blog. It was just too much effort to login to your Wordpress
account to even note down your thoughts as draft. Agreed, one can keep a
folder of drafts in your personal code repository but lets face the fact
- the path is just not smooth as we would like it to be.

This blog is generated using [Blogofile][] and is hosted on Amazon S3
using the excellent [Vaporfile][] script. In my attempt to learn refresh
my CSS knowledge, I have decided to have my own design. I will have
another post soon describing the steps and custom modification I did to
get the present setup.
