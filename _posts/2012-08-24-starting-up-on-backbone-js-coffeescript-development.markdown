For last one month, I have been trying to read and start upon
[Backbone.js](http://www.backbonejs.org). This is also going to be the first
where I will be writing serious JavaScript as all my previous experience with
JavaScript has been with using jQuery and generic DOM modifications.

So here are some observations from point of view of new entrant to dynamic web
app development.

* Understand about "this" and "scoping" in JavaScript. This is probably the
  biggest confusing element in JavaScript for people coming from C/Python/Ruby
  background. I am still not sure I understand 100% but these two links
  helped me a lot [What is "this"](http://howtonode.org/what-is-this) and 
  [Scope in JavaScript](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/scope_in_javascript/)

* Different library will use different ways to declare objects, closures etc.
  Don't worry too much about it in the beginning and start with whatever you
  feel comfortable with. As you grow and understand the inner workings of
  JavaScript, you will end up doing the right thing.

* Start with developing a mock application that you have been thinking of doing
  for
