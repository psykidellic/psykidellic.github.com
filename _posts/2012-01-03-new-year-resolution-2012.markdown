title: New year resolutions for 2012
---
First of all - Happy New Year to all my readers.

As is the norm, everybody makes a new year resolution list (with sliding
scale of perseverance to complete the list). Here is mine for this year:

*   Read as many books as I can [from this list][].
*   Since I have always been interested in having my own startup,
    another list of books to read [about startups][].
*   After working with C/C++ and dramatically opposite Ruby/Python, its
    time for me to learn something **in between** and my goal is to
    learn and write a simple progam in Scala.
*   Learn rock climbing. To fulfill this destiny, I have already join
    [Mission Cliffs][] which is just behind my workplace.
*   Cook more. I have been kinda slacking off on this after moving to
    SF.
*   Travel. 2011 was the worst year for me in terms of travelling and I
    plan to change that.
*   Last but not least, make 2012 better than 2011 which was not a
    particularly satisfying year for me.
