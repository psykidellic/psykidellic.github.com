title: Checking in again - kids, new job, Golang
---

Its holiday season and its time to that one of those yearly posts to let the
world know that I am alive and still going on.

My last checkin was in 2013 and since then, things that have transpired in life
are:

* Left Cisco Meraki to join a startup in security space
* The project didnt turn out the way we wanted and we got acquihired by Aruba
  Networks (part of HPE)
* I am father of two kids (3.5 son and 8 months daughter at the time of
  writing)
* Started learning (to get an overview idea) about containers and infrastructure
  orchestration
* Actively started working on real life project at work which involves
  development in golang instead of just reading various blogs. The old saying of
  implementing a real life project to learn was never more true
* Lost my 3rd kindle to carelessness. But on the other hand, my reading habits
  have improved and I almost always get about 15-30 minutes of reading before
  going to sleep
