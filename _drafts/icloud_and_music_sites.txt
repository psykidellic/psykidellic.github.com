title: Finding an item based on computed value
draft: true
---

Recently, at work I had to implement some code which had the pattern::

	#!python
	found = None
	for x in foo:
		if bar(x) == baz:
			found = x
			
One could do this in a more Pythonic way as::

	#!python
	try:
	    found = next(x for x in foo if bar(x) == baz)
	except StopIteration, e:
	    found = None
