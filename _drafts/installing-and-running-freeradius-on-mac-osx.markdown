If you use/develop on Mac OS X and dont use [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/](Hombrew), then stop reading this post and get it.

Now that we have homebrew installed, we will use it to install our FreeRadius server. Surprisingly, the formula is not called **freeradius** but **freeradius-server**.

{% highlight sh %}
brew install freeradius-server
{% endhightlight }
