title: git rebase - needed a single revison and interactive rebase already started
---
Recently at work, I was doing a *git rebase* and it failed due to some reason. After manually fixing it, I ran: **git rebase --continue** and it throws up::

	fatal: needed a single revison
	
After browsing through the docs and StackOverflow reading up, I figured the best way is to look for point before the rebase or at a state where you know its good::

	git reflog #look for the record e.g. {HEAD}@4
	git reset --hard {HEAD}@4
	
Then if you do::

	git rebase --continue
	
and get::

	Interactive rebase already started
	
the commands that worked for me::

	git rebase -i --abort
	git rebase --continue
