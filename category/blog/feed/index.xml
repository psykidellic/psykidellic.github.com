      <description>Setting up Xmonad and fun with xinitrc/xsession</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>Finally, after years of procastinating, I finally installed Xmonad on a new virtual machine that I have been setting up for another project. Since I have been doing almost everything new in the sphere of technology, might as well start a new experience with desktop environment.</p>
<p>Setting up Xmonad was a breeze with apt-get but the next step of setting up GDM to use xmonad for my session turned out to be more fun then I had imagined. When you start your Ubuntu you are presented with the login screen by GNOME. At this time, you can select various session/profile that you would like to use with the login. This information comes from files at <tt class="docutils literal">/usr/share/xession</tt>. One sample:</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=XMonad
Comment=Lightweight tiling window manager
Exec=xmonad
Icon=xmonad.png
Type=XSession
</pre></div>



<p>The above one is installed with xmonad and selecting the session while logging gives you the simplest <tt class="docutils literal">xmonad</tt> installation. Though this works, I wanted to configure something extra to my needs e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnome-session</span></tt> as it some of the window drawing look nicer (specifically Firefox, Chrome). So thinking that just like back in the days, I have to setup <tt class="docutils literal">.xinitrc</tt> file and it will work, I went ahead and created one with the details I needed. Logout and login and nothing happens. Figuring, I did something wrong I spent sometime making sure the config was correct to the best of my knowledge. Eventually, after much hassles and Googling, figured out Ubuntu uses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME/.xsession</span></tt> file. With the knowledge, just doing:</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>cp .xinitrc .xsession
</pre></div>



<p>and selecting <tt class="docutils literal">User Defined Session</tt> in the login window and everybody is happy. In my last 30hours or about of using <a class="reference external" href="xmonad">http://www.xmonad.org</a>, I am already loving it. No more time spent on resizing and moving around windows on my big monitor. Terminal is just <tt class="docutils literal">mod+space+return</tt> away and xterm with <strong>Droid Sans Mono</strong> is simmply gorgeous.</p>

      <description>Big changes and using blogofile with GitHub and BitBucket</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>Oh wow, its again almost 3 months before you see a new post from me. Couple of big changes in life that have happened over last couple of months.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I changed jobs and now I am a <em>Member of Technical Staff</em> at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meraki.com">Meraki</a>. We make the easiest Cloud Managed Enterprise Networks.</li>
<li>The new job entails me to work on Ruby on Rails so from now you will see rather less Python and more Rails/JavaScript posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a side note, as a chronic habit - a new post would mean that I have changed my way of writing and hosting my blog. Maybe, changing my system forces me to write a blogpost. Anyway, long story short, even though Blogofile is great, working with Vaporfile and S3 was just not working out. Then I found out Steve's post on <a class="reference external" href="http://hgtip.com/tips/beginner/2009-10-13-free-hosting-at-bitbucket/">Free Hosting at Bitbucket</a>. Since I use BitBucket as my DVCS provider, I wanted to check it out.</p>
<p>Creating a new repository with name <em>psykidellic.bitbucket.org</em> was not hard and pushing a build version of _site was even easier. Unfortunately, the way Bitbucket shows a static page is not compatible with Blogofile link generation. It would seem that blogofile creates links to post like <em>http://psykidellic.github.com/2011/06/08/finding-an-item-based-on-computed-value/</em> whereas the final page is <em>http://psykidellic.github.com/2011/06/08/finding-an-item-based-on-computed-value/index.html</em> and Bitbucket does not default to index.html. So all the links redirect back to the main page. Maybe there is something wrong with my configuration but I was too bored to dig deeper. I have seen various posts about using Blogofile with Github page and quick Googling brought me to <a class="reference external" href="http://manuel-ohlendorf.de/blog/2010/12/23/hosting-a-blogofile-blog-on-github-with-github-pages/">Manuels post</a>. It uses <em>git submodule</em> feature and reading upon similar Mercurial feature of <a class="reference external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Subrepository#Git_subrepositories">subrepos</a> say that <em>hg</em> supports git as subrepos natively.</p>
<p>I like to keep my drafts private and thus the original repository is private at Bitbucket. But the user facing has to be public. So in no time, I had <a class="reference external" href="http://psykidellic.github.com">psykidellic.github.com</a> up and running. Mercurial subrepos work great with git and you see the result. So now the flow of my post is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Continuously write drafts and commit.</li>
<li>When the time comes, blogofile build.</li>
<li>git add NEWFILES &amp;&amp; hg push</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>note:</strong> I am planning to make the third part as one script which should be easy depending upon your needs.</p>

      <description>Blog moved to Blogofile - add Google Analytics</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>As a continuation from my last post, listed below are the other two changes that I have applied to my setup.</p>
<div class="section" id="vaporfile-fix">
<h1>Vaporfile fix</h1>
<p>As you would know, I am using <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for this blog. I also use the excellent vaporfile script. After updating the second post yesterday, I found a bug with the script. After it updates an existing file (after matching the checksums), vaporfile fails to set the permission correctly. This results in <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> to have incorrect access permission and you end up getting AccessDenied from Amazon when you try to access your blog.</p>
<p>After around 20 minutes of investigation, I found the error and the patch is available at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psykidellic/Vaporfile/commit/0a866ad8715bb4267d6ee4f5672764f4e54b7e8a">my fork of the project</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="addition-of-google-analytics">
<h2>Addition of Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Apart from Disqus, I believe Google Analytics is probably the next feature that almost everybody uses. I plan to submit this patch to Blogofile in coming days but you just need to add the following to <tt class="docutils literal">_config.py</tt>:</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="c">### Google analytics integration</span>
<span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">analytics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="c">#### enter your &#39;web property id&#39; here</span>
<span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">analytics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;UA-XXXXXX-6&quot;</span>
</pre></div>



<p>and to <tt class="docutils literal">footer.mako</tt>:</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>% if bf.config.blog.analytics.enabled:

      <description>Blog moved to Blogofile</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I would have saved couple of hours by just reading the mailing list.</p>
<p>The following post is very much inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/12/06/my-blogofile-hacks/">this entry</a>. To get the blog up, I used <tt class="docutils literal">blogofile init simple_blog</tt> generating a minimal setup with no themes worked. I spent some time figuring out how to make my index page similar to chronological page. The docs was lacking on this part and in my eagerness, I went ahead and updated <tt class="docutils literal">index.html.mako</tt> with code from <tt class="docutils literal">chronological.mako</tt>. Realizing that its a criminal duplication of code, I was convinced that there has to be a better way. Quick walk through the mailing list pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/blogofile-discuss/browse_thread/thread/292c32bfe35b8466">following conversation</a>. Unfortunately, contrary to what is mentioned in the list, I had to set <strong>blog.path = &quot;&quot;</strong> in my <tt class="docutils literal">_config.py</tt>. Otherwise, all the links become <strong>http://page/1</strong> instead of <strong>http://MYHOST/page/1</strong>.</p>
<p>Setting up syntax highlighting for code samples using Pygments turned out to be more work then expected. It seemed after <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogofile.com/demo/sample_posts.html">reading</a> and this post by <a class="reference external" href="http://morgangoose.com/blog/2010/09/28/switching-to-blogofile/">Morgan Goose</a> led me to think that syntax highlighting will be automatically enabled. Unfortunately, it was not to be. I had to update the config file with (this options are present if you init blogofile.com):</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="n">filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">syntax_highlight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">style</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;murphy&quot;</span>
<span class="n">filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">syntax_highlight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">css_dir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;/css&quot;</span>
<span class="n">filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">syntax_highlight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">preload_styles</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;murphy&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post_default_filters</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;rst&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;rst, syntax_highlight&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>



<p>Apart from the above change, I also liked zzzeek's changes to the <tt class="docutils literal">syntax_highlight.py</tt> which enables me write code samples using <tt class="docutils literal">#!python</tt> directive. Lets face some facts - it will be sometime before I post anything other than Python.</p>
<p>Next step is to get yourself registered with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a> and setup Blogofile by adding to the config file:</p>


<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">disqus</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">disqus</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;YOUR-DISQUS-APPNAME&quot;</span>
</pre></div>



<p>As a side note, if you are using <tt class="docutils literal">VIRTUALENV</tt> along with blogofile, do not forget to start your environment name with <tt class="docutils literal">_</tt>. Otherwise, blogofile will simply copy it to _site and it will get synced to your remote folder. I just use <tt class="docutils literal">_ENV</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">ENV</tt>.</p>

      <description>Welcome Back</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>Hello, after a long hiatus and multiple attempts to get back to blogging, I think the time ripe is to take another attempt. Recently, I read <a class="reference external" href="http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/11/21/how-coders-blog/">a great article</a> by zzzeek which made a lot of sense. It seems that blogging would me much fun using the said workflow. Another <a class="reference external" href="http://buffered.io/2011/02/15/now-powered-by-blogofile/">blog post</a> pointed out similar issues that I was having with my old Wordpress blog. It was just too much effort to login to your Wordpress account to even note down your thoughts as draft. Agreed, one can keep a folder of drafts in your personal code repository but lets face the fact - the path is just not smooth as we would like it to be.</p>
<p>This blog is generated using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a> and is hosted on Amazon S3 using the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://blogofile.com/blog/2011/02/19/blogofile-on-amazon-s3/">Vaporfile</a> script. In my attempt to learn refresh my CSS knowledge, I have decided to have my own design. I will have another post soon describing the steps and custom modification I did to get the present setup.</p>
