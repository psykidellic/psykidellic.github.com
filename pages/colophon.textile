I believe we live in interesting times.

I am an Australian expatriate, 10+ year IT professional specializing in VoIP and iOS development living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

I genuinely enjoy writing and by nature I think a lot.  Writing helps to clear my head.

What I aim to have on this site is my tech analysis, thoughts on future trends and other forms of pattern recognition.
